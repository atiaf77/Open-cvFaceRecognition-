# Face and Eye Recognition Project

This project uses OpenCV to perform real-time face and eye detection using a webcam. It leverages pre-trained Haar Cascade models for detecting faces and eyes.

## Features
- Detects faces in real-time.
- Detects eyes within the detected face regions.
- Draws rectangles around detected faces and eyes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- OpenCV

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project OpenCV
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python FaceAndEyeRecognition.py
   ```
2. Press `q` to exit the application.
